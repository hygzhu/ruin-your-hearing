# ruin-your-hearing
A script that renders a grid of the same video being played at the same time. The resulting video is often very loud and may ruin your hearing.

Usage
```
python main.py --filename [Filename] --n [Iterations]
```

Note: The n flag stands for the number of videos you want to play simultaneously in the final resulting video where that number is 4^(n+1)
